# Fetch Project by Ryan Chen 

This project analyzes transactional, product and user data to identify key data quality issues and dicover business insights. 

## How to Use
- Open `FetchProject_RyanChen.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
- Run all cells to generate insights.
- A Jupyter Notebook was uploaded and both code & output should be available in the file. 

Let me know if you have any questions! 

Thanks,
